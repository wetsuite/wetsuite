- 👋 Hi, we are @wetsuite
- 👀 We work on legal tech
- 💞️ We are looking to collaborate/contribute prior experience/resources in:
  - NLP
  - graphs
  - interoperability at scale, across ogranizational boundaries
  - building momentum around transformative digital capabilities
  - collaborating across boundaries: academic, governmental, (not) for profit
  - We heard about the wetsuite project and think this is a promising initiative.
  - Looking for content on github, we noticed this user had yet to be registered.
  - We are ready to contribute, including this real estate, to the incipient project.
  - 📫 To get in touch, mail: pd20atae@duck.com
